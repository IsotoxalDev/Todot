# Todot
Todot is a kanban styled todo and planning addon for the [godot game engine](https://godotengine.org)

Why
--
Opening trello and going back and forth between it and godot is... not the most efficient thing sometimes. Depending on your internet connection or your willingness to open a browser while your ram has 100MB left, using it might just end up being counterproductive. But... with this addon, you've got all the boards and cards you could ever ask for - right beside the 2D, 3D, Script and AssetLib tabs. This addon works offline and you have access to it in the comfort of your own godot project. What more could you ask for? ( Note: This is an actual question. I want you to make issues for the features you need or that is never gonna come to todot. )

What to expect
--
1. You have to fix the font scaling issues your selves.
2. has a lot of bugs.

How to install?
--
Download this repository then copy the addon folder to your project root. If you have any other addons installed you might have to copy the Todot folder inside the addons folder to the addons directory inside your project

How to pronounce?
--
Depends. If you pronounce Godot as go - doh then pronounce it as to - doh. If you pronounce Godot as go - dot. then call it to-dot.

How is the data saved?
--
I collect all data and save it using the stor_var function in gdscript
